# Quick Start Guide - Web Dashboard

## Installation

1. **Install required packages:**
```bash
pip install flask flask-cors flask-socketio simple-websocket
```

## Running the Dashboard

### Method 1: Standalone Dashboard (Recommended for Testing)

Open a new terminal and run:
```bash
python dashboard.py
```

Then open your browser to: **http://localhost:5000**

### Method 2: Run with Main Bot

The bot now automatically saves signals to the dashboard storage. To view them:

1. In Terminal 1 (keep running):
```bash
python main.py
```

2. In Terminal 2 (new terminal):
```bash
python dashboard.py
```

3. Open browser to: **http://localhost:5000**

## Features

- ✅ **Real-time updates** via WebSocket
- ✅ **Filter by direction** (All/Long/Short)
- ✅ **Search by coin** (e.g., BTC, ETH)
- ✅ **Direct links** to TradingView and Binance
- ✅ **Dark theme** with responsive design
- ✅ **Auto-refresh** fallback if WebSocket disconnects

## Notes

- Dashboard runs independently of Telegram
- Signals are stored in `data/dashboard_signals.json`
- Maximum 100 signals kept in storage (auto-cleanup)
- Works on any device with a browser (PC, tablet, phone)

## Troubleshooting

**Dashboard shows no signals:**
- Make sure signals are being generated by running `python main.py`
- Check `data/dashboard_signals.json` exists and has data

**WebSocket not connecting:**
- Close and reopen the browser
- Check if port 5000 is available
- Try restarting the dashboard

**Port already in use:**
- Edit `config.py` and change `DASHBOARD_PORT` to another port (e.g., 5001)
